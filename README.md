## Description

An exploratory exercise to learn more about testing React.js components with
Jest.

This is a simple React.js component that truncates content to the specified
height and decorates it with "Read more" and "Read less" functionality.
Instructions for seeing a demo are below.

There is a test failure that depends on checking the height of an HTML element.
I'm not sure how to fix this but am open to suggestions.

## Install Dependencies

    npm install

## Run Tests

    npm test

## View Demo

    npm start
    open http://localhost:8081
